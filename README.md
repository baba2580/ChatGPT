  <p align="center">ChatGPT Desktop Application ( Windows )</p>
</p>


**This is an unofficial project solely intended for personal learning and research. Since the ChatGPT desktop application was open-sourced, it has garnered a lot of attention, and I want to thank everyone for their support. However, as the project progressed, two issues have arisen that greatly impact its future development:**

- **Some individuals have repackaged and sold it for profit.**
- **The name and icon of ChatGPT could potentially lead to infringement disputes.**

## ðŸ“¦ Install

- [ðŸ•’ History versions...](https://github.com/baba2580/ChatGPT/releases/tag/v1.0.0v)

<!-- tr-download-start -->

### Windows

- [ChatGPT_v1.0.0v_windows_x86_64.msi](https://github.com/baba2580/ChatGPT/releases/download/v1.0.0v/ChatGPT_1.0.0_windows_x86_64.msi): Direct download installer
  

**Note: If the installation path and application name are the same, it will lead to conflict ([#142](https://github.com/lencx/ChatGPT/issues/142))**

## ChatGPT Prompts!

You can look at **[awesome-chatgpt-prompts](https://github.com/f/awesome-chatgpt-prompts)** to find interesting features to import into the app. You can also use `Sync Prompts` to sync all in one click, and if you don't want certain prompts to appear in your slash commands, you can disable them.


## âœ¨ Features

- Win-platform: `Windows`
- Text-to-Speech
- Export ChatGPT history (PNG, PDF and Markdown)
- Automatic application upgrade notification
- Common shortcut keys
- System tray hover window
- Powerful menu items
- Support for slash commands and their configuration (can be configured manually or synchronized from a file [#55](https://github.com/lencx/ChatGPT/issues/55))
- Customize global shortcuts ([#108](https://github.com/lencx/ChatGPT/issues/108))
- Pop-up Search ([#122](https://github.com/lencx/ChatGPT/issues/122) mouse selected content, no more than 400 characters): The application is built using Tauri, and due to its security restrictions, some of the action buttons will not work, so we recommend going to your browser.

## Thanks

- The core implementation of the share button code was copied from the [@liady](https://github.com/liady) extension with some modifications.
- Thanks to the [Awesome ChatGPT Prompts](https://github.com/f/awesome-chatgpt-prompts) repository for inspiring the custom command function for this application.
